Red Wine Quality Classification
In this project, classification models were built by examining the "winequality-red" data set available on Kaggle.

ðŸ“Œ 8 models were identified and it was observed that the best model for this data set was Random Forest.

ðŸ“Œ Hyperparameter optimization was performed to get a better result in the Random Forest model.
